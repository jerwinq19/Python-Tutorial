# 🎁 What is a Variable?
# Think of a variable like a box where you can put things.
# You give the box a name (label), and you can open it later
# to see what's inside or replace it with something new.
#
# Examples (different kinds of "boxes"):
name = "Jerwin"        # 📦 a box holding text (string)
age = 20               # 📦 a box holding a whole number (integer)
money = 105.40         # 📦 a box holding a decimal number (float)
student = True         # 📦 a box holding a True/False value (boolean)

# 📝 Naming Conventions for Variables:
#
# 1. snake_case → words are separated by underscores.
#    Example:
user_name = "Jerwin"   # like labeling your box: "user_name"
#
# 2. camelCase → start with lowercase, but "bump up" the first
#    letter of every new word.
#    Example:
passwordInput = "mysupersecretpassword123"
#
# ✅ In Python, the standard is to use snake_case.
